## Tangram Two

This is the next iteration of a piece of [artwork](https://github.com/Michael-Day/simple-demo) that itself was a branch of the basic [Tangram](http://github.com/tangrams/tangram) example.

(Live demo: http://tangrams.github.io/simple-demo/)

I'm working on multiple layers, incorporating p5.js, and generally playing with it to make a browser-based artwork.
